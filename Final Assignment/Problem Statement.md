<div align="justified">Mumbai is India's second largest city and its financial capital, commercial and entertainment capital. The city is home to around 12 million people and continues to attract thousands of migrants from rest of the country, thereby earning the moniker 'City of Dreams'. </div>
The backbone of the city is indubitably its railway network, called the Mumbai Suburban Railway. The network consists of 6 lines and has an average daily ridership of around 7 million. It would not be wrong to say that the daily lives of the people in Mumbai heavily depends on the functioning of the railway network. As such, the network plays an important role in the economic progress of the country. \
